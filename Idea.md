# Educational Minecraft Server Plugin Technical Specification

## Overview
Develop a Minecraft plugin for PaperMC that creates an educational environment where players (school-age children) can learn through gameplay. The plugin will alternate between regular gameplay during the day and educational quizzes at night.

## Core Functionality

### Day-Night Cycle
- Night duration: 90 seconds (fixed)
- Day duration: 30 seconds + 20 seconds per correct answer from the previous night
- Implement a custom day-night cycle independent of the vanilla Minecraft cycle

### Classroom
- Dimensions: 15x10x5 (interior)
- Location: Y-coordinate 200
- Construction:
    - Walls: Stone bricks
    - Floor: Alternating glass and oak planks in a checkered pattern
    - Ceiling: Glass
    - Lighting: Wall-mounted torches
    - Blackboard: Black concrete
- Protection: Players cannot break or place blocks in the classroom

### Teleportation System
- At night start: Teleport all players to the classroom
- At day start: Return players to their previous locations
- Save player coordinates before teleportation
- Handle player logins:
    - If logging in during night, teleport to classroom
    - If logging in during day, spawn at last daytime location

### Inventory Management
- During night: Make player inventories inactive (but visible)
- During day: Restore full inventory functionality

### Quiz System
- Use existing button and sign system (A, B, C, D options)
- Display questions using hologram system (ArmorStand entities)
- Hardcode a set of questions initially (prepare for future API integration)
- 2-second delay between questions
- Simple sound effect for correct/incorrect answers (e.g., thunder sound)

### Scoring
- Award points for correct answers
- Use points to calculate the next day's duration

## Technical Requirements

### Commands
- `/createroom`: Creates the classroom (admin only)

### Events to Handle
- Day start
- Night start
- Player join
- Player interact (for quiz answers)
- Block break (for classroom protection)

### Optimization
- Ensure efficient teleportation of multiple players
- Optimize question display and answer processing

## Future Considerations (Not in current scope)
- Integration with AI for question generation
- Leaderboard system
- Difficulty scaling based on player count
- Visual effects for correct/incorrect answers

## Development Phases
1. Implement basic room creation and protection
2. Develop custom day-night cycle
3. Create teleportation and inventory management systems
4. Implement quiz system with hardcoded questions
5. Develop scoring and day duration calculation
6. Add sound effects for answers
7. Thorough testing and bug fixing

## Notes
- Ensure code is well-commented and follows best practices
- Regularly commit changes to version control
- Document any dependencies or required server configurations
